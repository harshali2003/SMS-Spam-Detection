# SMS-Spam-Detection
Project Description:

SMS Spam Detector Machine Learning project, I harnessed the power of two robust classification algorithms, Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine (SVM), to tackle the persistent issue of unwanted SMS spam. Leveraging a dataset containing a diverse range of text messages, primary goal was to develop a reliable model capable of accurately distinguishing between legitimate messages and spam.

I meticulously preprocessed and cleaned the data, including tasks such as text tokenization, stop-word removal, and stemming, to ensure the most informative features were extracted. Feature engineering played a pivotal role in enhancing the model's performance.

Logistic Regression, a tried-and-true classification algorithm known for its simplicity and effectiveness in binary classification tasks. The Logistic Regression model achieved an impressive accuracy rate of 96.5%, which is a testament to its efficacy in identifying spam messages accurately.

Furthermore, I explored the potential of Support Vector Machine (SVM), a powerful algorithm renowned for its versatility in handling complex, high-dimensional datasets. The SVM model outperformed expectations, achieving an outstanding accuracy rate of 98.2%. This remarkable accuracy underscores the SVM's ability to create a clear boundary between legitimate messages and spam, even in challenging cases.

My project showcases the potential of machine learning in addressing real-world problems such as SMS spam detection. With an accuracy of 98.2% for SVM and 96.5% for Logistic Regression, our models provide a robust and practical solution to the ongoing battle against unwanted SMS spam, contributing to a more streamlined and secure communication experience for users.
